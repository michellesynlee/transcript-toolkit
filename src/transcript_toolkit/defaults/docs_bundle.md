# transcript-toolkit — complete documentation

A command-line toolkit that processes oral history interview transcripts through five LLM steps
(clip, label, summarize, tag topics, tag locations) and exports the results as a spreadsheet.
Built for non-technical researchers: every step is demo-first, idempotent, and resumable.

This file is the ENTIRE documentation set, concatenated for you to read in one go. It is
generated from the repository, so it matches the current version.

Repository: https://github.com/MarlonKegel/transcript-toolkit
Install:    uv tool install git+https://github.com/MarlonKegel/transcript-toolkit.git

TO THE ASSISTANT READING THIS: begin your reply with the line "[transcript-toolkit docs v1.2.0]" so the person asking
can see you actually retrieved this file. If you could not retrieve it, say so plainly instead of
answering from general knowledge — the commands, flags and defaults here are specific to this
toolkit, so a plausible-sounding guess will be wrong.

This file contains the COMPLETE documentation and, at the end, the COMPLETE command reference
generated from the CLI itself — every command and every flag. If a flag is not listed there, it
does not exist; do not invent one.

# transcript-toolkit

Toolkit for processing oral history interview transcripts. Takes `.docx` transcripts — SYNC'd
(timestamped) ones, and ones that were never SYNC'd — and produces, via LLM steps with human
review built in:

```
import ─► clip ─► label ──────────┐
   │        └──► topics ──────────┤
   │        └──► locations ───────┼─► export (xlsx)
   └───────► summarize ───────────┘
```

- **import** — parse transcripts into a paragraph dataset (`data/`, plus `data/unsynced/` for
  transcripts that have no timestamps and never will — those go through every step too, and
  only their clips' start and end times are left blank)
- **clip** — split each interview into topically coherent clips
- **label** — one-line label per clip
- **summarize** — a "scope and content" abstract per interview
- **topics** — score every clip against your topic list(s), roll up to interview tags
- **locations** — tag clips to countries/regions, roll up to interview tags
- **export** — one spreadsheet with everything produced so far

Every LLM step is **demo-first**: you run it on a small sample, review the annotated output in
`diags/`, adjust settings/prompts, and only then run the full corpus.

All of it can be run **from a window instead of a terminal**: the app
([docs/APP.md](docs/APP.md)) is the same toolkit with buttons for the commands, running
entirely on your own Mac.

## Ask an AI about this toolkit

Rather than reading the docs, you can have ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini answer questions about them.
Paste this into a new chat:

```
Read the documentation at this link, then answer my questions about this toolkit:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarlonKegel/transcript-toolkit/main/llms-full.txt
```

That link is the entire documentation — every page, plus a complete list of every command and
flag — as one plain-text file. Give the assistant **that** link, not the GitHub repo link:
GitHub's file pages are rendered with JavaScript and aren't in most search indexes, so an
assistant handed the repo URL will answer from general knowledge and get the specifics wrong.

**Check that it actually read it.** The file asks the assistant to begin its reply with
`[transcript-toolkit docs v…]`. If that line is missing, it did not fetch the file, and its
answer is a guess no matter how confident it sounds — some assistants will say "I read the
documentation" and then invent flags. (Not all chat tools can fetch URLs; this varies by
product and plan.)

**The method that always works:** run **`toolkit docs`**. It writes
`transcript-toolkit-docs.md` into the current folder — drag that file straight into the chat.
No fetching, no plan restrictions, and it's the documentation for the version you actually
have installed.

## Quickstart

```sh
# one-time install (see docs/SETUP.md for the full Mac walkthrough, incl. installing uv)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/MarlonKegel/transcript-toolkit.git
```

Point-and-click from here on — one more command puts **Transcript Toolkit** in your
Applications folder, and everything else happens in its window
([docs/APP.md](docs/APP.md)):

```sh
toolkit app --install-launcher
```

Or carry on in the terminal:

```sh
toolkit init my-archive && cd my-archive
#  → put your OpenAI key in .env, drop transcripts in data/
toolkit import
toolkit status

toolkit update                 # ...and to get the latest version later
```

# FILE: docs/SETUP.md
# Installing it on a Mac, step by step
================================================================================================

# Setup (Mac)

One-time setup takes about 20 minutes. You'll copy commands into **Terminal** (find it with
Spotlight: press `⌘ Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter). Paste each command with `⌘V` and
press Enter, then wait for it to finish (you get the prompt back).

## 1. Install Apple's Command Line Tools (this gives you `git`)

A fresh Mac doesn't include `git`, which the installer in step 3 needs. Install it once:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

A window pops up — click **Install**, agree to the terms, and wait for it to finish (a few
minutes; it's a sizeable download). If it instead says *"command line tools are already
installed"*, you're set — carry on. Wait until that install is fully done before the next steps.

## 2. Install uv (a Python installer/manager)

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Close the Terminal window and open a new one afterwards (so the `uv` command is found).

## 3. Install the toolkit

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/MarlonKegel/transcript-toolkit.git
```

Check it worked:

```sh
toolkit --version
```

To update to the latest version later:

```sh
toolkit update
```

The toolkit also tells you, at most once a day, when a newer version is out. It never updates
itself — that is always your call.

## 4. Rather not use Terminal? Install the app

Everything from here on can be done in a window instead. One more command:

```sh
toolkit app --install-launcher
```

That puts **Transcript Toolkit** in your Applications folder — open it like any other app, and
[APP.md](APP.md) takes over from this page: creating a project, adding your key and your
transcripts all happen in the window. Steps 5–7 below are the Terminal way of doing the same
things; skip them if you use the app.

## 5. Create a project workspace

Pick a folder name for your project (here `my-archive`):

```sh
cd ~/Documents
toolkit init my-archive
cd my-archive
```

The project is then called "My Archive" wherever a name is shown. To choose the name instead
and let the folder follow from it, give `--name`:

```sh
cd ~/Documents
toolkit init --name "Anderson Family Oral History"    # -> anderson-family-oral-history/
```

Either way there is only ever one name to keep track of.

This creates the project folder with everything in place: `config.yaml` (your settings),
`prompts/` (editable prompt texts), `topics/` (your topic lists go here), `data/` (transcripts
go here), `outputs/` (results appear here), `diags/` (review files appear here).

## 6. Add your OpenAI API key

Every LLM step calls the OpenAI API with a key billed to your team. Ask your admin for a key.
`toolkit init` already created a `.env` file inside your project folder — you just need to add
the key to it. Make sure you are inside the workspace (the `cd my-archive` from step 5), then
open it (it's hidden in Finder — in Terminal: `open -e .env`) and paste the key after the `=`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then **save the file** (in TextEdit: `⌘S`) and close it — the key isn't stored until you save.

## 7. Add transcripts and import

Copy your SYNC'd transcript `.docx` files into `data/` (one file per interview, or per session
for multi-session interviews — see [steps/import.md](steps/import.md) for the required
file-naming and timestamp format). Then:

```sh
toolkit import
```

Read what it prints: the speaker-role table shows whether your interviewer labels are
configured correctly (fix `config.yaml` → `import:` and re-run if not), and the
narrator-pooling table shows which session files it grouped together.

From here, follow [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md).

## If something goes wrong

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md). The golden rule: the toolkit fails loudly and
tells you what to fix; interrupted runs are never lost — run the same command again and it
picks up where it stopped.

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/APP.md
# The app: the same toolkit in a window instead of a terminal
================================================================================================

# The app

Everything the toolkit does, in a window instead of a terminal. It runs on your own Mac —
nothing is uploaded anywhere, and there is no account to sign into. Behind the window it runs
exactly the same commands this documentation describes, and shows you each one as it goes, so
what you learn here still applies if you ever want to type them yourself.

## Starting it

Once, after installing the toolkit (see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) steps 1–3):

```sh
toolkit app --install-launcher
```

That creates **Transcript Toolkit** in your Applications folder — the one in Finder's sidebar.
Open it, and drag it to your Dock if you want it there. From then on, double-clicking it is how
you start.

On a Mac where you are not allowed to write to `/Applications` (some managed machines), it goes
into your own `~/Applications` instead, which is *not* the Applications in Finder's sidebar. The
command tells you which one it used and how to get there. Either way, Command-Space and typing
the name finds it.

macOS may ask once whether the app can access files in your Documents folder — say yes, that
is where your projects live. It only asks again if the app is rebuilt.

You can also start it from a terminal, which is useful if something goes wrong and you want to
see the messages:

```sh
toolkit app
```

## How it behaves

**It keeps running when you close the window.** That is deliberate: a run over a whole
collection takes hours, and closing a browser tab should not throw that away. Come back to the
tab later — or open the app again — and you will find the run still going, with its output
where you left it.

**One thing runs at a time.** If a step is already going, the app says so rather than starting
a second one. Batch API runs are the awkward case: they can take up to a day, and they hold the
slot. Stopping one is safe (see below), and re-running the step afterwards picks the batch back
up without paying twice.

**Stopping is always safe.** Every call that has finished is saved. Stop a run halfway and run
it again tomorrow, and it carries on from where it stopped rather than starting over.

**Quit it when you are done** — the gear in the top right corner → Quit the toolkit. Also do that
after installing an update: the copy that is already running keeps using the old version until
you restart it.

## Finding your way around

The bar across the top has three things in it. On the **left**, the toolkit's icon and the
version you are running; clicking the icon takes you to the list of all your projects. In the
**middle**, the project that is open. On the **right**, the gear, which opens Settings from
wherever you are.

- **Home** (the icon) is every project on this Mac, what stage each one has reached, and the
  place to start a new one.
- **Workspace** is the open project: what to do next, its transcripts, the interviews the demos
  run on, and the pipeline.
- Then **one page per step**, and **Export**.

Every page that can run something ends with a **Terminal Viewer**. Inside it is the command
being run and its output, exactly as Terminal would show it — the app is a window onto the
command-line tool this documentation describes, and that panel is the tool itself working. You
never have to read it. It is there so you can see what is happening, and so you can copy a
command out and run it yourself if you ever want to.

While something is running, its own state — how far it has got, and a Stop button — appears
directly under the button you pressed, wherever on the page that is. When it finishes it folds
back to a single line with a tick, so a page you have worked through does not fill up with
panels about things that are over.

## Working through a project

The workspace page always names one next thing to do, and the pages follow the same order.

1. **Workspace** — paste your OpenAI key, drop the `.docx` files in, import them, and pick the
   interviews the demos will run on. Some things worth knowing:

   - **You name the project, not its folder.** "Anderson Family Oral History" gets the folder
     `anderson-family-oral-history`; Home shows you which folder before it makes it. **Browse**
     opens a folder picker, so you never have to know or type a path — though you still can.
   - **One list of transcripts**, showing every `.docx` in the project, whose interview it is,
     how many paragraphs were read out of it, and whether it has been imported yet. A
     drag-and-drop that half worked is visible here rather than something you find out about
     three steps later. Dropping a corrected transcript under its old filename **replaces** the
     old file, the row says *changed — import again*, and importing takes the superseded
     results with it (see [steps/import.md](steps/import.md)). On a big collection the list scrolls inside itself, so what comes after
     it is still on screen.
   - **How transcripts are read** — which speaker labels are the interviewer, and which endings
     to strip off a filename — is folded up under that list, because it is the one thing you may
     have to correct before importing again.
   - **Pick the sample of interviews for demos**, once: every step's demo uses the same few, so
     what you read after the clip demo and after the label demo is about the same people. Say
     how many first, then either let them be drawn or choose them yourself — the messy
     transcript, the multi-session narrator. Between 3 and 10; 5 is the usual number, and a
     bigger sample makes every demo proportionally more expensive. Afterwards the interviews
     that were picked are listed, and you can take one out, add a particular one, or add a few
     more at random.

2. **Each step in turn** — clip, label, summarize, topics, locations. Every one is the same
   three moves:

   1. **Try it** on the demo interviews. Nothing is saved to the project and it costs a small
      fraction of the whole collection.
   2. **Read what came out.** The step writes review pages; the page says what to look for in
      them. They open in a tab of their own, and each interview has a link back to the list.
      On the Label step the review pages are also where a label can be fixed by hand — an
      *edit* control sits next to each one, and your version is kept everywhere labels appear
      (see [steps/label.md](steps/label.md)).
   3. **Then one of these** — change the prompt or a setting and try it again, or run it on
      everything.

   Running it on everything is not offered until the demo has been run, because the toolkit
   refuses it anyway: a full run needs a demo it recognises behind it. Change a prompt, a model
   or a setting and it will ask for a fresh demo, because the old one no longer tells you what
   you would get.

   **A button that would do nothing is greyed out and says so.** Once a step has run over
   everything and nothing that would change the answer has been edited since, running it again
   would send the same calls, get the same answers back out of the cache, and write the same
   files. Hover it and it says that, and what to change to get a different result. Change
   anything — the prompt, the model, a setting, the topic list — and it comes back by itself.
   So do the things that stay useful: *Rebuild these pages* is never greyed out, and neither is
   the comparison, which is meant to be run again with different numbers. Two cases deliberately
   keep the button live: results you have deleted (re-running puts them back, and the calls are
   already paid for), and a collection that has grown since the last full run — then it says
   there is more to do, and running it again does only the new part.

   **Topics** needs a topic list first. Write one in the app — one row per topic, a name and a
   description of what belongs under it — or upload a spreadsheet you already have. What you
   type is kept as you go, and the first time you save it asks what to call the list. The
   description is the only thing the model reads when deciding whether a clip belongs to a
   topic, so it is worth saying what does *not* count as well as what does.

   You can have **more than one topic list**, and each gets a tab of its own, with a tab at the
   end that adds another. Two lists are two pieces of work: separate demos, separate results, and
   their own prompt, model and thinking effort — so a fine-grained list can run on a stronger
   model than a coarse one without either dictating the other. A new list starts on the shared
   prompt; *Give this list its own prompt* is what splits it off. Whichever list you uploaded is
   editable in the same table you would have typed it into, and an Excel file stays an Excel
   file.

   **Locations** has a vocabulary of its own in the same place: *The regions the model may use*.
   It is a strict list — the model cannot answer with anything that is not on it — so it is the
   first thing to change when the region tags are wrong. Saving also says which of those regions
   the country mapping has no entry for, because *Expand regions into countries* stops at one it
   does not know.

   **Topics and Locations have two more moves after that**, because tagging clips is not the
   same as tagging interviews. See below.

3. **From clip tags to interview tags** — on Topics and on Locations, once the whole collection
   is tagged. A clip is what the model reads; a catalogue entry is about an interview. So the
   tags have to move up, and that needs a threshold: how much of an interview has to be about
   something before it is one of that interview's subjects.

   - **Decide how to go from clip tags to interview tags** writes a page with a panel per method,
     each drawing what that way of deciding would tag: one bar per topic, showing how many
     interviews it would reach and the threshold it had to clear. The two binned methods are
     drawn as a grid — one row per number of bins, one column per range — so both can be read at
     once. Whatever your saved results were rolled up with is marked; a rule you have set but not
     yet applied is not, because it has not happened yet. Nothing is sent to OpenAI, so compare
     as often as you like. *What to compare* changes what is drawn.
   - **Roll up to interview tags** is where you set the rule and apply it — one move, because
     they are one decision. Two numbers do the work: how many bins, and the lowest and highest
     threshold. The recommended method gives rarer topics a lower threshold; one threshold for
     everything sounds simpler but buries exactly the topics worth finding. The other methods
     are behind *Use a different method*. Rolling up is free and instant, so changing your mind
     costs a re-run and nothing else.

   Locations works the same way, with one wrinkle: regions are rolled up as regions and only then
   expanded into their countries, so a country becomes an interview's place through a region only
   when the region itself is what that interview is about.

4. **Export** — one Excel file with everything produced so far. Steps that have not run are
   simply left out, so exporting early is fine; run it again later and it will have more in it.

The **project cost report** on the workspace page is what the project has actually cost, per step
and in total. It counts every call ever made in it, demos included, so it is money that has left
the account rather than an estimate. Every step page carries its own share of it beside the
heading, in the same place each time — what something has already cost is asked before deciding
to spend more. (In Terminal: `toolkit cost`.)

At the foot of each step page, **Extra tools** holds the things that are not part of a normal
run: rebuilding review pages from results you already have, and seeing how a long interview will
be divided up before it is sent. Buttons that read something a step has not produced yet are
greyed out, and say what is missing when you hover them.

### Transcripts that were never SYNC'd

Sometimes a narrator revises a transcript so heavily that the recording no longer matches it, and
the edited text becomes the record. Those transcripts have no timestamps and never will.

The Workspace page's transcript list has a fold underneath it, **Transcripts that were never
SYNC'd**, with a drop box of its own. Files dropped there are kept in their own folder, and the
same **Import** reads them: they are clipped, labelled, summarized and tagged like every other
interview, because a clip is a run of paragraphs and paragraph numbers are something every
transcript has.

The one difference is that their clips have no start and end time. The spreadsheet leaves those
cells empty, the review pages show a paragraph range instead, and the Interviews tab's
**Transcript** column says which interviews they are — so an empty Start is visibly a fact about
the transcript rather than something that went wrong.

They have their own folder rather than going in with the rest because a transcript that *should*
have timestamps and does not is a mistake worth catching: dropped in with the others it is
refused and named, and moving it to this fold is how you say the missing times are deliberate.

## Changing what a step does

Two things on every step page change what comes back, and they are on that step's own page
rather than behind the gear:

- **The prompt for this step** — the instructions sent with every call. Rewording them changes
  what comes back. It is the project's own copy, so an edit here changes nothing in any other
  project, and *Put the original back* restores the one the toolkit ships with.
- **Settings for this step** — which model does the work, how much thinking it does, and
  whatever else belongs to that step alone. How clip tags become interview tags is *not* here:
  it belongs to the rollup, which is further down, next to the comparison that informs it.

Labelling also takes **house rules**: a short set of project decisions added to the end of the
prompt — how a name is spelled, what to call something, what never to abbreviate. Write them in
the app; they are saved as a file in the project like everything else.

Each setting is shown with the explanation written beside it in the project's `config.yaml`. If
you reword a comment in that file, the app says the new wording: there is one description of a
setting, and the file is where it lives. Saving writes back into `config.yaml` itself, comments
and all, so a project stays a folder you can open in TextEdit.

Saving either one makes that step's demo out of date, which is the point — try it again and read
the result before running the whole collection.

## What it costs, and when it asks

Nothing is spent without a question first. When you start a full run, the step works out how
many calls it needs and how many it already has cached, then asks — in the app, with buttons:

- **Run now** — results in this session.
- **Use the Batch API** — half the price, but up to a day.
- **Cancel**.

Both prices are shown, and the `i` beside the buttons explains what you are choosing between.
The figures are worked out by the step itself, not by the app, so what you see is what will
actually be spent. On Clip the Batch API runs in waves (an interview's chunks build on each
other), and the question says how many waves — half price, but count in days rather than
hours.

Demos do not ask: they are small on purpose, usually a few cents.

## When something goes wrong

The app shows the toolkit's own message, which says what to fix. Two of them come with a button
that does the fixing:

- *"No demo sample drawn yet"* — the demo needs a handful of interviews chosen to run on; the
  chooser appears on the step page as well as on the workspace page.
- *"No demo run recorded"* / *"the demo is stale"* — the demo-first rule, above.

Anything else: read the message, and see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

If the app itself will not start, the messages from the last launch are in
`~/Library/Logs/transcript-toolkit/launch.log`. If it says the port is in use by another
program, start it somewhere else and make that permanent:

```sh
toolkit app --install-launcher --port 8378
```

## Settings

**The gear in the top right corner** opens Settings, from any page. It holds only what is about
the whole project or the installation — a setting that belongs to one step is on that step's page:

- the project's name
- which version you have, whether a newer one exists, and **Update to the most recent
  version** — then quit the app and open it again, because the copy already running keeps
  using the old version until you do
- the button that rebuilds the desktop app
- where the project's files are, and a button that shows the folder in Finder
- **Delete this project**, which asks you to type DELETE and tells you how many transcripts and
  results go with it. On a Mac it moves the folder to the Trash, so a wrong answer is
  recoverable.
- **Quit the toolkit**.

## If your project folder moves or disappears

Renaming a project folder in Finder, moving it to another disk, or throwing it away are all
ordinary things to do, and nothing warns Finder that the app has it open. When the toolkit next
looks and the folder is not there, it closes the project and asks on the workspace page:

- **I moved or renamed it** — point it at the folder's new home and everything carries on. The
  project is intact; only its path changed.
- **I deleted it** — the toolkit forgets it and you are back at a clean start.

Neither answer loses anything the toolkit was holding.

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/WORKFLOW.md
# The demo-first workflow, costs, and what to do when a step hangs
================================================================================================

# The workflow, end to end

The pipeline (after [setup](SETUP.md) and `toolkit import`):

```
import ─► clip ─► label ──────────┐
   │        └──► topics ──────────┤
   │        └──► locations ───────┼─► export (xlsx)
   └───────► summarize ───────────┘
```

`clip` must run before `label` / `topics` / `locations`; those three are independent of each
other; `summarize` only needs `import`. `export` includes whatever has been produced so far.

## Demo-first: how every LLM step is run

Each LLM step costs real money on a full corpus and its behavior depends on prompts and
settings you can tune. So every step follows the same loop, and the toolkit **enforces** it:

1. **Demo** — run the step on a small sample: `toolkit <step> --demo`
   (for clip/label the sample is the interviews drawn once by `toolkit sample`; topics and
   locations sample clips automatically). You can demo the steps in sequence — `label --demo`
   works off `clip --demo`, so you can review the whole pipeline on a few interviews before
   committing to a full run of anything.
2. **Review** — the demo opens a review page in your browser (a self-contained `.html` file in
   `diags/<step>/` — on a Mac it opens automatically; elsewhere, double-click it). Judge the
   output: are clip boundaries sensible, labels sharp, tags right?
3. **Adjust** — edit `config.yaml` (models, thresholds), the step's prompt in `prompts/`
   (`toolkit status` names the file each step reads), or your topic list, and go back to 1. Every
   demo is cheap, and repeated runs re-use everything already computed.
4. **Full run** — `toolkit <step>` (no flags). This only starts if a demo of the *current*
   prompt+settings has been made (otherwise it tells you what changed), asks you to confirm the
   spend (see below), and then processes the whole corpus. Results land in `outputs/`, review
   files in `diags/`.

The app ([APP.md](APP.md)) runs this exact loop: each step page's *Try it* → read the review
pages → adjust or *run on everything* are these four moves, enforced the same way.

### If a step seems stuck

Occasionally one API call stops responding while the rest finish — you'll see progress reach,
say, 134 of 136 and then sit there. **Press Ctrl-C (more than once if it doesn't stop the first
time), then run the exact same command again.** It picks up where it left off and usually
completes immediately.

Nothing is lost and nothing is paid for twice: every finished call is written to the cache as it
completes, so a re-run only redoes what was still missing. The same is true after a laptop sleep,
a dropped network, or a crash — the fix is always "run it again".

A call that is merely slow now says so (`still waiting on a gpt-5.6-sol call (94s elapsed)`), so
silence for more than a minute or two is the signal to interrupt.

## Run now, or run cheap? (the Batch API)

Demos always run immediately. On a **full run**, the confirmation asks how to send the work, with
both prices worked out from your own demo:

```
Tag 801 clip(s) with gpt-5.6-luna (0 already cached, 801 fresh call(s)).
  [1] Run now       ~$4.30   results in this session
  [2] Batch API     ~$2.15   50% cheaper, up to 24h turnaround
  [n] Cancel
Choose [1/2/n]
```

Pick **[1]** when you want the results now — that's the normal choice. Pick **[2]** when the run
is large and you can wait: OpenAI's Batch API is half price but has no speed guarantee (often
much faster than 24h, but don't count on it). A batch job is resumable — press Ctrl-C and re-run
the same command later and it re-attaches to the same job rather than paying again.

Skip the question with `--batch` or `--no-batch`; `--yes` runs immediately without asking.
Available on every money step. On `clip` it is the slow road: an interview's chunks build on
each other, so a batch run goes in waves — every interview's next chunk at a time, each wave up
to 24h — and the prompt says how many waves your collection needs. Half price, but count in
days rather than hours (see [steps/clip.md](steps/clip.md)).

## A typical project, in commands

```sh
toolkit import                 # parse transcripts; check the printed tables
#   a transcript that has no timestamps and never will goes in data/unsynced/ — import reads
#   that folder too, and those interviews go through every step (docs/steps/import.md)
toolkit sample                 # pick the demo interviews (once)

toolkit clip --demo            # demo → review page opens → adjust → re-demo
toolkit clip                   # full corpus
toolkit label --demo           #   (same loop)
toolkit label

toolkit summarize --demo
toolkit summarize

#   drop your topic list into topics/ first (collection.xlsx or .csv: name, description)
toolkit topics tag --set collection --demo    # → review page opens → tune the list → re-demo
toolkit topics tag --set collection
toolkit topics thresholds --set collection    # compare how tags could be decided → a review page
toolkit topics rollup --set collection        # apply it: clip tags → interview tags

toolkit locations tag --demo   # works out of the box (built-in region list)
toolkit locations tag
toolkit locations map          # regions → countries
toolkit locations thresholds   # compare how tags could be decided → a review page
toolkit locations rollup       # apply it: clip tags → interview tags

toolkit export                 # one xlsx in outputs/ with everything so far
toolkit status                 # where things stand, and what each step is waiting for
toolkit cost                   # what has been spent so far
```

## Cost expectations

Rough production figures from the project this toolkit grew out of (35 interviews, ~800
clips): clipping ≈ a few dollars; labels ≈ a few dollars; summaries well under a dollar;
topic tagging ≈ $2–3 per taxonomy; location tagging ≈ $3 (half with `--batch`). `toolkit cost
--to-n N` extrapolates from your own demo runs.

## Where things live

| Folder | What | Do you edit it? |
|---|---|---|
| `config.yaml` | the settings meant to be adjusted | yes |
| `advanced/` | everything else tunable | rarely |
| `prompts/`, `topics/`, `locations/` | prompt texts, topic lists, region vocabulary | yes |
| `data/` | your transcripts + the imported dataset | you add files |
| `outputs/` | deliverables (tables + export.xlsx) | never by hand |
| `diags/` | review pages (`.html`) from demos and runs | open them in a browser |
| `.toolkit/` | caches and run state | never |

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/import.md
# import: transcripts (.docx) -> the paragraph dataset
================================================================================================

# import

`toolkit import` — parse the transcripts in `data/` into `data/paragraphs.parquet`, the dataset
every other step reads.

## Input: transcript files

Put one `.docx` per interview (or per session) into `data/`. Requirements:

- **Timestamps.** Ideally **every paragraph** begins with its own `[HH:MM:SS]` (a fully SYNC'd
  transcript) — this gives the most precise per-clip start/end times. Each speaker turn must at
  minimum begin with `[HH:MM:SS] SPEAKER: text`. If a turn spans several paragraphs and only the
  first is timestamped, the toolkit still runs, but a clip that starts or ends mid-turn inherits
  the *turn's* timestamp, so its timing is coarser — import prints a **⚠ Timestamps** warning
  naming those transcripts. A file with no timestamps at all is rejected loudly.
- **File names → interview id.** The id is the filename with the `strip_suffixes` removed and
  spaces/commas turned into underscores, lowercased. `Ramos_Ana_20240115_session1_SYNC.docx` →
  `ramos_ana_20240115_session1`; `Ramos, Ana_SYNC.docx` → `ramos_ana`.
- **Multi-session interviews.** Name them `{Name}_{YYYYMMDD}_session{N}` so the toolkit groups a
  narrator's sessions together for summaries and interview-level tags. Single-file interviews
  need no session token.

## What it does

Reads the printed output carefully:

- **Speaker roles table** — every distinct speaker label, classed as Interviewer / Other /
  Narrator. If your interviewer shows up as "Narrator", set `import.interviewer_labels` in
  `config.yaml` to your interviewer's label(s) and re-run.
- **Timestamps line** — confirms every paragraph is timestamped, or warns (⚠) that some
  transcripts are timestamped per speaker-turn only (see above).
- **Narrator-pooling table** — which session files were grouped into one narrator. If a
  grouping is wrong, the filenames don't follow the session convention.
- Details (per-turn-only transcripts, paragraphs before the first turn, and benign
  continuation-paragraph notes) go to `logs/import_warnings.log`.

## Settings

`config.yaml` → `import`: `interviewer_labels`, `other_labels`, `strip_suffixes`.
`advanced/import.yaml`: `session_regex` (the multi-session token pattern), `write_csv`.

## Output

`data/paragraphs.parquet` (+ `.csv`). Re-running is safe and cheap; do it whenever you add or
change transcripts.

## Re-importing a corrected transcript

A corrected transcript comes back under the filename it always had — drop it into `data/` (or
onto the app, which replaces the old file and says so) and run `toolkit import` again. Import
keeps a record of what each file looked like when it was read in, so it knows the difference
between the same file again and a changed one:

- **Unchanged files** keep their original imported-at timestamp — the record means "when this
  text came in", not "when import last ran".
- **A changed file** replaces its old rows AND takes its old results with it: the clips,
  labels, summaries and tags made from the superseded text are removed from `outputs/` (and
  any hand-edited labels for it), the steps show that there is work to do again, and import
  prints exactly what happened. Re-running the steps redoes only the changed interviews —
  everything else is already cached and comes back free.
- The **Interviews tab of the export** shows each transcript's imported-at date and time, so a
  spreadsheet can be checked against a correction: exported before the correction was imported
  means that row is out of date.

## Transcripts that were never SYNC'd

Sometimes a narrator revises a transcript so heavily that the recording no longer matches it,
and the edited text becomes the record. Those transcripts have no timestamps and never will.
Put them in `data/unsynced/`.

`toolkit import` reads that folder along with `data/`, into the same dataset — so these
interviews are clipped, labelled, summarized and tagged like every other one. A clip is a run of
paragraphs, and paragraph numbers are something every transcript has. **The one difference is
that their clips have no start and end time**, so those cells are empty in the spreadsheet and
the review pages show a paragraph range (`¶12–¶19`) where the others show a time.

- A turn starts at `SPEAKER: text`; every other paragraph continues the turn it is in. A label
  on every one of a speaker's paragraphs (`Hellam:` before each) is fine.
- Everything before the first speaker — the title page, the preface — is **left out** of the
  interview and written to `logs/import_warnings.log`, so you can check what was dropped.
- The same narrator must not be in both folders: sessions are pooled by name, so one person
  arriving from both would be two half-interviews claiming one row. Import refuses it and says
  which pair.
- `toolkit import --unsynced` still works and does exactly what `toolkit import` does.

**Why two folders, if it is all one collection?** Because a transcript with no timestamps in
`data/` is usually a mistake — a wrong file, a broken export — and import fails loudly on it
rather than quietly treating it as text-only. Moving it to `data/unsynced/` is how you say the
missing times are deliberate.

In the app this is on the Workspace page, folded under the transcript list.

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/sample.md
# sample: choosing the interviews demos run on
================================================================================================

# sample

`toolkit sample` — choose the handful of interviews that `clip --demo` and `label --demo` run
on. Run it once, after `toolkit import`; the choice is remembered.

## Run it

```sh
toolkit sample                       # 5 interviews, picked reproducibly
toolkit sample --n 8                 # a bigger sample
toolkit sample --seed 3              # a different draw
```

Every demo you run from then on covers the whole sample, so a bigger sample costs
proportionally more each time you try a step out. Five is the default for that reason.

**Between 3 and 10.** Fewer than three does not show enough to judge a prompt by; more than ten
costs more than it tells you, since every step's demo is run several times over. Both ends are
refused with the reason. (To process a chosen few interviews for real rather than as a demo, use
`toolkit clip --interview <id>` instead.) A collection of fewer than three interviews is the one
exception: then the sample is all of them.

## Choosing the interviews yourself

**You do not have to accept a random draw.** Name the interviews you want:

```sh
toolkit sample --interviews ramos_ana,kramer_larry,acemoglu_daron
```

Or name the ones you care about and let the rest be drawn for you — `--n` is the size of the
whole sample, so this gives those two plus three others:

```sh
toolkit sample --n 5 --interviews ramos_ana,kramer_larry
```

Use the interview ids exactly as `toolkit import` printed them (lowercase, underscores — the
filename with its suffixes stripped). An unknown id fails immediately and lists the valid ones,
so a typo can't silently give you a different sample.

In the app this is **Pick the sample of interviews for demos** on the workspace page: the same
choice, with the interview list in front of you. It asks how many first, then whether to draw
them or choose them; afterwards it lists the ones it picked, and each can be taken out, swapped
for a particular interview, or topped up with a few more at random — every one of those runs
`toolkit sample` with the interviews it should end up with.

This is worth doing when the random five aren't representative — pick a short interview and a
long one, a single-session and a multi-session narrator, or the transcript you know is messiest.
The demo is only useful if it shows you the cases you're actually worried about.

## Why it exists

Every LLM step is demo-first: you run it on a few interviews, review the result, adjust, and only
then spend money on the whole corpus. Fixing the sample means each step demos on the *same*
interviews, so when you compare clip boundaries against the labels they produced, you're looking
at the same material.

Re-running `toolkit sample` replaces the sample. Do that between steps and your earlier demos no
longer correspond to the current one — harmless, but the comparison is lost.

## What it writes

`.toolkit/demo_sample.txt`, one interview id per line. `toolkit status` shows the current sample.

## Which steps use it

| step | demo sample |
|---|---|
| `clip --demo`, `label --demo` | exactly these interviews |
| `topics tag --demo`, `locations tag --demo` | a spread of *clips* drawn from whatever clips exist (`advanced/<step>.yaml` → `demo_n_clips`) |
| `summarize --demo` | its own small draw (`advanced/summarize.yaml` → `demo_n`), since summaries read whole interviews and are the priciest per call |

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/clip.md
# clip: splitting interviews into topically coherent clips
================================================================================================

# clip

`toolkit clip` — split each interview into topically coherent **clips** (contiguous ranges of
paragraphs). Clips are the unit that `label`, `topics`, and `locations` work on.

## Run it (demo-first)

```sh
toolkit sample          # once: pick the demo interviews
toolkit clip --demo     # clip just those → review page opens in your browser
toolkit clip            # full corpus (after a demo of the current settings)
```

`toolkit clip preview` shows how each interview would be chunked (for long interviews) without
calling the API. `toolkit clip annotate` re-renders the review pages from existing results.

A full run asks whether to run now or on the 50%-off
[Batch API](../WORKFLOW.md#run-now-or-run-cheap-the-batch-api) — but clip is the slow one to
batch. A long interview's chunks run in sequence (each chunk's prompt carries the previous
chunk's clip decisions as locked context), so they can't all be submitted up front; a batch run
goes in **waves** instead, every interview's next chunk at a time, and each wave can take up to
24h. The prompt says how many waves your collection needs. Half price — but count in days
rather than hours; on interviews short enough for one chunk each, it is one wave like any
other step.

## Reviewing

The demo opens `diags/clip/index.html` in your browser (on a Mac; elsewhere, double-click it).
It links one page per interview, each showing the transcript with clip boundaries marked. Judge
whether boundaries fall at real topic shifts and whether procedural chatter (scheduling, mic
checks) is separated out. To adjust, edit `prompts/clip_interview.md` or the chunking settings,
then re-demo.

## Settings

`config.yaml` → `clip`: `model`, `reasoning`. `advanced/clip.yaml`: `chunk_threshold_tokens`
(interviews above this are processed in overlapping chunks), `overlap_paragraphs`, `max_workers`,
`verbosity`, `prompt`.

## Output

`outputs/clips/clips.parquet` (one row per clip) and `outputs/clips/paragraphs_clipped.parquet`
(every paragraph with its clip id; procedural paragraphs marked). Interrupted runs resume — just
re-run.

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/label.md
# label: a one-line label per clip
================================================================================================

# label

`toolkit label` — give each clip a one-line label (a short declarative phrase, like a chapter
title). Needs `clip` to have run.

## Run it

```sh
toolkit label --demo    # label the sample's clips → review page opens in your browser
toolkit label           # full corpus
```

`toolkit label preview` shows the grouping (labels are produced several clips at a time, with
neighbouring clips shown as read-only context so labels stay distinct — that grouping is about how
many clips share one request, and is unrelated to the Batch API below). `toolkit label annotate`
re-renders the review pages. A full run asks whether to run now or on the 50%-off
[Batch API](../WORKFLOW.md#run-now-or-run-cheap-the-batch-api).

## Reviewing

`diags/label/index.html` links one page per interview showing each clip with its label (the demo
opens it for you). Check that labels are specific, distinct, and
in your house style. For project-wide consistency rules (e.g. "always write UNHCR, never the UN
Refugee Agency"), put them in a file and point `config.yaml` → `label.addendum` at it (e.g.
`prompts/prompt_addendums/label_addendum.md`); the text is appended to the label prompt.

## Fixing a label by hand

Sometimes one label needs one word changed, and re-prompting the model over it is the wrong
tool. Three ways to fix it yourself, all landing in **`label_overrides.csv`** at the workspace
root:

- **In the review page** (app only): an *edit* control sits next to each label — change it
  right where you read it. Labels you fixed are marked *edited by hand*.
- **In the exported sheet**: edit the Label column of `outputs/export.xlsx`; the next
  `toolkit export` notices the difference against what it wrote last time and keeps your
  version instead of overwriting it. Editing a cell back to the model's own words lifts the
  override again.
- **In the file itself**: `label_overrides.csv` is a plain table (`clip_id,label,...`) you can
  edit in any editor.

The model's own labels in `outputs/labels/` are never rewritten — your version is laid over
them wherever labels are shown or exported. An override is pinned to its clip's span, so if the
clip itself changes (a corrected transcript is re-imported, or clip boundaries move), the
override is dropped with a printed warning rather than silently applied to different text.

## Settings

`config.yaml` → `label`: `model`, `reasoning`, `addendum`. `advanced/label.yaml`:
`batch_threshold_tokens`, `max_workers`, `verbosity`, `prompt`.

## Output

`outputs/labels/labels.parquet` (the clips table plus a `label` column).

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/summarize.md
# summarize: a 'scope and content' abstract per interview
================================================================================================

# summarize

`toolkit summarize` — a short "scope and content" abstract for each interview. Independent of
clipping; needs only `import`.

## Run it

```sh
toolkit summarize --demo   # summarize a couple of interviews → review page opens in your browser
toolkit summarize          # all interviews
```

By default a narrator's sessions are pooled into one summary; `--no-pool-sessions` (or
`summarize.pool_sessions: false`) summarizes each session file separately. A full run asks whether
to run now or on the 50%-off [Batch API](../WORKFLOW.md#run-now-or-run-cheap-the-batch-api).

## Reviewing

`diags/summarize/summaries.html` lists each summary with its length (the demo opens
`demo_summaries.html` for you). Check for accuracy (nothing invented),
coverage of the main through-lines, and length. Tune the tone/length in
`prompts/summarize_interview.md`.

## Settings

`config.yaml` → `summarize`: `model`, `reasoning`, `pool_sessions`. `advanced/summarize.yaml`:
`verbosity`, `max_workers`, `demo_n`, `prompt`.

## Transcripts that were never SYNC'd

They are summarized along with everything else — they are part of the collection (see
[import.md](import.md)). `toolkit summarize --unsynced` picks out just those, the way
`--interview` picks out a few named ones, which is useful when you have added some and do not
want to walk the whole collection again.

The Interviews tab of the export marks them, so a reader can see why those rows' clips carry no
times.

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/topics.md
# topics: scoring clips against your own topic lists
================================================================================================

# topics

`toolkit topics` — score every clip against a **topic list** you provide, then roll the clip
tags up to interview-level tags. Needs `clip` to have run.

## Provide a topic list

**Put a spreadsheet in `topics/`. The filename is the name of the set — that's the whole setup.**

`topics/collection.xlsx` → the set is called `collection`. Then:

```sh
toolkit topics tag --set collection --demo
```

The first time you use a set, the toolkit adds it to `config.yaml` for you, so its rollup
settings are there to adjust later. You never have to edit config to get started.

Every workspace ships with `topics/example_topics.csv` — **fill it in with your topics and
rename it** to whatever you want the set called. Or bring your own file; `.csv` and `.xlsx`
both work. The columns:

| column | required | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | the topic's display name (also the tag shown in the export) |
| `description` | yes | what belongs under it — the model reads *only* this to decide. Be specific: say what counts **and what doesn't**. |
| `id` | no | a short code; auto-derived from the name if omitted |

Several topic lists? Drop in several files. `topics/collection.xlsx` and `topics/filter.csv`
give you `--set collection` and `--set filter`, tagged independently, each with its own outputs,
its own demo, and its own cache. A list can also carry **its own prompt, model and reasoning**
(`sets.<set>.{prompt, model, reasoning}`), because a fine-grained list and a coarse one are two
different pieces of work; anything it does not set, it takes from the `topics` section.

**In the app** this is the Topics page, with one tab per list and a tab that adds another — by
writing it in the table there or by uploading a spreadsheet. The table edits the same file the
run reads, whether that is a `.csv` you typed here or an `.xlsx` you brought (an Excel file stays
one, and other sheets in the workbook are left alone). It is checked against the rules above as
you save it, and the first save is where you name the set. Until you name it, what you type is
kept in `topics/example_topics.csv`, which no run will ever tag against. Each tab carries its own
prompt and settings, and *Give this list its own prompt* is what splits it off from the shared
one.

There is **no default set** — every `toolkit topics` command needs `--set`. Tagging a whole
corpus against the wrong taxonomy is expensive, so the set is always named explicitly. Forget it
and the error lists the sets you have.

## Run it

```sh
toolkit topics tag --set collection --demo   # sample of clips → review page opens in your browser
toolkit topics tag --set collection          # full corpus
toolkit topics thresholds --set collection   # compare how tags could be decided (writes a page)
toolkit topics rollup --set collection       # apply it: clip tags → interview tags
```

`toolkit topics preview --set collection --clip <id>` prints the exact request for one clip.
Demos include a per-topic justification by default (off for full runs) — useful for judging
borderline calls. A full run asks whether to run now or on the 50%-off
[Batch API](../WORKFLOW.md#run-now-or-run-cheap-the-batch-api) — worth considering here, since you
pay for a full pass per taxonomy.

## Reviewing and tuning

Every run writes a page: a demo writes `diags/topics/<set>_demo.html` and opens it for you, and a
full run writes a per-interview page for every tagged clip, linked from `<set>_index.html`.
(`toolkit topics annotate --set <name>` rebuilds those pages from the tags you already have —
free and instant.) Each clip is scored
0/1/2 per topic (0 = no, 1 = maybe, 2 = yes); a clip is "tagged" with a topic at score 2. If
topics are over- or under-applied, sharpen the `description` in your spreadsheet and re-demo —
that text, not the code, is where the tagging rules live.

## Rolling up: decide, then do

The **rollup** decides when an interview gets a topic — how big a share of that interview's clips
has to be tagged with it. That is a judgement about your collection, so look before choosing:

1. `toolkit topics thresholds --set <name>` writes `diags/topics/<set>_thresholds.html`: a
   foldable panel per method, each drawing what that rule would tag — how many interviews every
   topic would reach, and the threshold it had to clear. The binned methods are drawn as a grid,
   one row per number of bins and one column per range, so both dimensions can be read at once.
   Whatever your saved results were rolled up with is marked; a rule you have set but not yet
   applied is not, because it is a plan rather than a state of the project. Nothing is sent to
   OpenAI, so run it as often as it takes. `--bins 5,9`, `--ranges 10-30,20-40` and
   `--flat 20,30,40` change what is drawn (defaults in `advanced/topics.yaml` under `compare`).
2. Set `sets.<set>.rollup` in `config.yaml` to the one you settled on — the default is
   `{ method: freq_width, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }`, and [CONFIG.md](../CONFIG.md) has the
   three methods — then `toolkit topics rollup --set <name>`. It is free and deterministic, so
   changing your mind costs a re-run and nothing else. (In the app these are one move: you set
   the rule inside the button that applies it.)

One threshold for every topic is the obvious rule and usually the wrong one: set it high enough
for a common topic to mean something and the rare topics — often the interesting ones — never
reach it. `freq_width` asks less of a rarer bin, and its thresholds spread out only as far as
the frequencies themselves do — topics that come up about equally often face (nearly) the same
threshold, so an evenly-spread collection is judged flat without you switching methods. That
adaptivity is why it is the default.

## Settings

`config.yaml` → `topics`: `model`, `reasoning` (the default for every list), and
`sets.<set>.{file, rollup, prompt, model, reasoning}` — the last three override the step's for
that list alone (written for
you when a set is first used). `advanced/topics.yaml`: `score_values`, `justify_min_score`,
`demo_n_clips`, `max_workers`, `prompt`.

## Output

`outputs/topics/<set>_clip_topics_{wide,long}.parquet` (clip scores) and
`<set>_interview_topics_{wide,long}.parquet` (interview tags).

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/locations.md
# locations: tagging clips to countries and regions
================================================================================================

# locations

`toolkit locations` — tag each clip with the **countries and regions** it is substantively
about, map regions down to countries, and roll up to interview-level tags. Needs `clip`. Works
out of the box — a region vocabulary and a region→country mapping ship with the toolkit.

## Run it

```sh
toolkit locations tag --demo   # tag a sample of clips → review page opens in your browser
toolkit locations tag          # full corpus  (asks: run now, or 50%-off Batch API?)
toolkit locations map          # expand regions to countries, apply the label canon
toolkit locations thresholds   # compare how tags could be decided (writes a page)
toolkit locations rollup       # apply it: clip tags → interview tags
```

`toolkit locations preview --clip <id>` prints the request for one clip.

## The vocabulary is yours to edit

- `locations/regions.yaml` — the region names the model may use (a strict list; ships with a UN
  Geoscheme-based default plus common historical/political regions). Editing it changes both the
  prompt and the allowed outputs, so they never drift. **In the app**: *The regions the model may
  use*, on the Locations page — it also says which of them `region_to_country.csv` has no
  countries for, since `map` refuses a region it does not know.
- `locations/region_to_country.csv` — how each region expands to countries in the `map` step.
- `config.yaml` → `locations.relabel` — spelling/merge fixes applied to model output (e.g.
  `Czech Republic: Czechia`). `locations.place_tags` — subnational places to keep as their own
  tag (e.g. `Crimea`).

## Optional: survey your corpus first

If you want to build a custom region list, `toolkit locations survey` runs an offline
named-entity pass over your transcripts and reports the places mentioned. It needs the extra
dependencies (`pip install "transcript-toolkit[survey]"`, plus a spaCy model and a GeoNames dump
— the command tells you exactly what's missing).

## Reviewing

Every run writes a page: a demo writes `diags/locations/demo.html` and opens it for you, and a
full run writes `diags/locations/locations.html` for the whole corpus. Each shows every clip
with its country/region tags, and its justifications on demo runs. Check that only substantive
places are tagged, not passing mentions. The prompt is `prompts/tag_locations.md`.

`toolkit locations annotate` rebuilds `locations.html` from the tags you already have — free and
instant, for picking up a change to the page itself without paying for the step again.

## Rolling up: decide, then do

Same moves as [topics](topics.md#rolling-up-decide-then-do), and the same rule methods (see
[CONFIG.md](../CONFIG.md)); `locations.rollup` holds the choice, and the default is
`{ method: freq_width, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }`. `toolkit locations thresholds` writes
`diags/locations/locations_thresholds.html`.

What is particular to places is the **hybrid rollover**, which the comparison works through so
its counts are the ones a rollup would really write. Two rollovers run per narrator under the
same rule:

1. **Direct places** — an interview is tagged a place when enough of its clips name that place
   with direct evidence.
2. **Regions** — an interview is tagged a region when enough of its clips are about that region;
   only then is the region expanded into its countries (`region_to_country.csv` + `relabel`).

The interview's places are the union of the two. So a country arrives through a region only when
the *region itself* is what the interview is about — not by accumulating scattered per-country
shares, which would quietly tag a lot of countries nobody talked about. The last panel of the
comparison page shows that choice against the two simpler alternatives. A place that only ever
comes up inside a region has no bar of its own; on the page it is drawn grey, with the bar of the
region that carried it in.

## Output

`outputs/locations/clip_locations*.parquet` (raw tags), `clip_countries*.parquet` (after
region→country mapping), `interview_locations_*.parquet` and `interview_regions_long.parquet`
(interview tags).

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/steps/export.md
# export: one xlsx of everything produced
================================================================================================

# export

`toolkit export` — collect everything produced so far into one spreadsheet,
`outputs/export.xlsx`.

## Run it

```sh
toolkit export                 # -> outputs/export.xlsx
toolkit export --out final.xlsx
```

Incremental: it includes whatever steps have run. Clips only? You get a Clips tab with ids and
timings. Added labels, topics, locations, summaries? Each fills in its columns. Re-run any time;
it overwrites the file. `toolkit status` shows what the next export would include.

## What's in it

- **Clips** — one row per clip: Clip Id, Interview (narrator), Session, Start, End, Label, a
  column per topic set (the clip's tags), Locations (and Regions, depending on the mode below).
  **Start and End are empty** for a clip out of a transcript that was never SYNC'd — there are
  no times in it to report (see [import.md](import.md)). Everything else in the row is filled
  in as usual.
- **Interviews** — one row per narrator: Sessions, Summary, a column per topic set (interview
  tags), Locations (and Regions), and **Imported** — when each of the narrator's transcripts
  was read in (see [import.md](import.md)), so a sheet can be checked against a later
  correction. If any transcripts came in without timestamps
  (`data/unsynced/` — see [import.md](import.md)), a **Transcript** column says which rows are
  SYNC'd and which are not: those interviews are clipped and tagged like the rest, but their
  clips' Start and End are empty, and this column is what says that is a fact about the
  transcript rather than something that went wrong.
- **Categories** — the vocabularies (each topic set's names, the country and region lists) as
  reference columns. These follow the same mode, so you never see a reference value that appears
  in no row.

## A project prefix on every id

`config.yaml` → `export.id_prefix` (e.g. `osf_`) is put in front of every Clip Id, Interview and
Session the spreadsheet shows — `osf_fake_alpha_20240101_session1_0001` — so ids from different
projects stay distinct once their sheets are combined. It is a fact about the spreadsheet only:
the workspace's own files, review pages and `label_overrides.csv` keep the plain ids, and changing
the prefix takes a re-export and nothing else. Labels you edited in the previous sheet are still
found and kept, whatever prefix that sheet was written with.

## How locations appear

The tagger records **countries** and **regions** separately, and `toolkit locations map` expands
each region into its countries. Pick which of those views the spreadsheet shows with
`config.yaml` → `export.locations` (or `--locations MODE` for a one-off):

| mode | Locations column | Regions column |
|---|---|---|
| `countries` | only countries tagged directly | — |
| `countries_and_regions` *(default)* | only countries tagged directly | the region tags |
| `countries_incl_regions` | direct countries **plus** the regions mapped down to countries | — |

For a clip tagged `Czechia` + the region `The Balkans` (which maps to Serbia, Croatia, …):

```
countries              Locations: Czechia
countries_and_regions  Locations: Czechia          Regions: The Balkans
countries_incl_regions Locations: Czechia, Serbia, Croatia, …
```

The first two never fold regions into the countries column, so each tag appears exactly once —
use `countries_incl_regions` when you want one country column that misses nothing. Subnational
**place tags** (`locations.place_tags`, e.g. Crimea) count as directly tagged in every mode; only
region *expansions* are what the modes add or withhold.

## Labels you edited in the sheet

Re-running `toolkit export` does not undo a Label cell you changed by hand. Before overwriting
the file, export compares the sheet against what it wrote last time; a Label that differs was
edited by a person, and the edit is kept — recorded in `label_overrides.csv` (see
[label.md](label.md)) and written into the new file too. Editing a cell back to the model's own
words lifts the override again. The one thing export cannot read is a workbook that is open in
Excel or damaged — then it stops and says so rather than risk losing your edits.

## A note on Google Sheets

This is a plain `.xlsx`. Excel has no "multiple selections per cell" validation, so the tag
columns are comma-separated text and the Categories tab is just a reference list. If you upload
the file to Google Sheets and want the tag columns to be multi-select dropdowns bound to the
Categories vocabulary, you add that validation in Sheets by hand — the toolkit can't set it in
an xlsx file.

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/CONFIG.md
# Every setting, and which edits invalidate a demo
================================================================================================

# Configuration reference

Two levels, both YAML, in the workspace:

- **`config.yaml`** — the settings you're expected to change. One section per step.
- **`advanced/<step>.yaml`** — everything else tunable, rarely needed.

For a given step the two are merged; a key set in `config.yaml` wins. **Changing any setting
that shapes an LLM call (model, reasoning, a prompt, a topic list) makes that step's previous
demo "stale"** — the next full run will ask you to demo and review again. That's intended.

**The comments in `config.yaml` are the documentation of each setting, and the app reads them.**
It shows the comment directly above a key (plus any comment on the key's own line) as that
setting's explanation, so rewording one here changes what the app says — there is one description
of a setting and this file is where it lives. Two conventions follow from that: keep a comment
directly above its key with no blank line between, and keep the two-space indentation, which is
what lets the app change one line and leave the rest of the file — comments included — exactly as
it was. A file that has been reindented by hand still works for every command; the app just
declines to write to it and tells you to make the change here yourself.

The app shows the settings in two places: those belonging to the whole project (its name) behind
the gear, and those belonging to one step on that step's own page. `advanced/` is not shown in
the app at all — those are files to edit.

## `config.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: "..."                     # shown in `toolkit status`, the app and the export.
                                  # Set by `toolkit init` from the folder name (or --name);
                                  # edit it here to rename the project without moving it.

import:
  interviewer_labels: [Q]         # speaker labels used by the interviewer
  other_labels: []                # other non-narrator voices (moderators, etc.)
  strip_suffixes: [_SYNC, _final] # filename endings removed to derive the interview id

clip:      { model: gpt-5.6-sol,      reasoning: medium }
label:     { model: gpt-5.6-terra,      reasoning: medium, addendum: null }
summarize: { model: gpt-5.6-sol,      reasoning: low,    pool_sessions: true }

topics:
  model: gpt-5.6-luna
  reasoning: medium
  sets:                           # written for you when a set is first used; no default set
    collection:
      file: topics/collection.xlsx  # your topic list (xlsx/csv: name, description, [id])
      rollup: { method: freq_width, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }
      # or:  { method: equal_count, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }
      # or:  { method: flat, threshold_pct: 30 }
      # prompt: tag_topics_strict.md   # this list's own rubric, a file in prompts/
      # model: gpt-5.6-sol             # and its own model / reasoning, overriding the two above
      # reasoning: high

locations:
  model: gpt-5.6-luna
  reasoning: medium
  rollup: { method: freq_width, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }
  relabel: {}                     # output spelling/merge fixes, e.g. {Macedonia: North Macedonia}
  place_tags: []                  # subnational places kept as their own tag, e.g. [Crimea]
```

- **model / reasoning** — the OpenAI model and reasoning effort (`none|low|medium|high|xhigh`)
  for that step. Higher reasoning = better but pricier. Model ids the pricing table knows are in
  `defaults/pricing.yaml`.
- **label.addendum** — path (relative to the workspace) to project-specific labeling rules, or
  `null`.
- **summarize.pool_sessions** — pool a narrator's session files into one summary.
- **topics.sets** — one or more topic lists; each has a `file` and a `rollup` rule (below). A
  list may also carry its own `prompt`, `model` and `reasoning`, which override the `topics`
  section for that list alone — two lists are two pieces of work, with separate demos and
  separate caches.
- **rollup** (per topic list, and once for locations) — when a topic or place becomes one of an
  interview's tags. `method` is one of:
  - `freq_width` (the default) — the topics are split into `bins` bins by how often they come
    up across the collection, over `range: [lowest, highest]` percent of an interview's clips,
    and a rarer bin gets a lower threshold. Five bins over 10–30% make the ladder 10, 15, 20,
    25, 30. Two topics that come up equally often always get the same threshold, and the
    thresholds fan out from the middle of the range only as far as the frequencies themselves
    are spread — a collection where every topic comes up about equally often is judged
    (near-)flat, instead of tiny count differences being stretched to the extremes.
  - `equal_count` — the same, except each bin holds the same number of topics. It spreads the
    thresholds evenly over your list, at the cost of splitting equally-frequent topics between
    bins.
  - `flat` — one `threshold_pct` threshold for every topic.

  `toolkit topics thresholds --set <name>` and `toolkit locations thresholds` draw what each of
  these would tag before you choose. The older spelling (`scheme: flat|binned` with the
  thresholds written out as `thresholds: [...]`) is still read, and a hand-written list is still
  used exactly as written.
- **locations.relabel / place_tags** — see [steps/locations.md](steps/locations.md).
- **export.locations** — how location tags appear in the xlsx: `countries` (only those tagged
  directly), `countries_and_regions` (default; those countries plus a separate Regions column), or
  `countries_incl_regions` (one column, with regions mapped down into it). See
  [steps/export.md](steps/export.md).
- **export.id_prefix** — put in front of every Clip Id, Interview and Session in the xlsx, e.g.
  `osf_`, so ids from different projects never collide once combined. Empty (default) for none.
  Only the spreadsheet changes; changing it takes a re-export and nothing else.

## `advanced/<step>.yaml`

Per step: `prompt` (the file in `prompts/` used), `verbosity`, `max_workers`, poll settings, and
step-specific tunables — `clip`: `chunk_threshold_tokens`, `overlap_paragraphs`; `label`:
`batch_threshold_tokens` (how many clips share one request — nothing to do with the Batch API);
`topics`/`locations`: `demo_n_clips`, `demo_seed`, and for topics `score_values`,
`justify_min_score`; `import`: `session_regex`; `locations`: `regions_file`, `region_map_file`,
`survey.*`; `export`: `filename`, `tabs`.

The steps that can use the Batch API (`clip`, `label`, `summarize`, `topics`, `locations`)
also take `batch_poll_interval_s` and `batch_max_total_wait_s` — how often to check a submitted
job, and when to stop waiting (re-running the command resumes the same job). On `clip` a batch
run goes in waves — see [steps/clip.md](steps/clip.md).

## Prompts and vocabularies

Editable files, read live at run time (changing them re-stales the demo):

- `prompts/*.md` — one prompt per LLM step. Restore a pristine copy with
  `toolkit init --reset-prompt <name>`. `toolkit status` prints which file each step reads, and
  the app has the same file behind *The prompt for this step* on that step's page.
- `topics/*.csv|xlsx` — your topic lists.
- `locations/regions.yaml`, `locations/region_to_country.csv` — the location vocabulary and
  mapping.

# FILE: docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
# Errors and what to do about them
================================================================================================

# Troubleshooting

The toolkit fails loudly: when something is wrong it stops and prints what to fix. Common cases:

**Install: "Git operation failed … `git init` … No developer tools were found".** Your Mac
doesn't have `git` yet, and `uv tool install git+https://…` needs it to fetch the code. Install
Apple's Command Line Tools once — run `xcode-select --install`, click **Install** in the dialog,
wait for it to finish, then re-run the `uv tool install …` command (this is step 1 of
[SETUP.md](SETUP.md)). The unrelated `python3.14 … native extensions` warning above the error is
harmless — the git line is the real failure.

**"OPENAI_API_KEY not set"** — put your key in the workspace's `.env` file
(`OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`). Ask your admin for a key.

**"OpenAI refused the request: the OpenAI account is out of credit"** (or *"has reached a billing
limit"*). Nothing is wrong with your project or your key, and nothing you have run is lost —
whoever looks after your OpenAI account needs to put money on it. Send them the message the
toolkit printed; it names the two pages they need. The one that catches people out is the
**credit balance** (platform.openai.com → Settings → Organization → Billing): a balance of zero
stops every call even when the monthly spending limit is nowhere near being reached, and if
auto-recharge is switched on but the balance is still empty, the automatic payment is being
declined by the bank — buying credit by hand on that page works when the automatic charge does
not. Once it is topped up, re-run the same command and it carries on from where it stopped.

**"Not inside a toolkit workspace"** — run the command from inside your project folder (the one
`toolkit init` created), or pass `--project /path/to/project`.

**A step is stuck / hangs / stops making progress.** Press **Ctrl-C** (several times if the first
doesn't take), then re-run the exact same command. This resolves it almost every time: the
finished calls are cached, so the re-run only retries the ones that never came back. Usually it
completes straight away. A call that is just slow prints `still waiting on ... (94s elapsed)`,
and one that never returns is abandoned after 10 minutes so the run can't hang forever.

**A run stopped partway (laptop slept, network dropped, you hit Ctrl-C).** Nothing is lost. Run
the exact same command again — every completed call is cached and won't be paid for twice; it
picks up where it stopped.

**"No demo run recorded" / "the demo … is stale".** A full run needs a demo of the *current*
settings first. Run the step with `--demo`, review the file it points to in `diags/`, then run
the full command. "Stale" means you changed a prompt, model, or setting since the last demo — so
re-demo to see the effect before spending on the whole corpus.

**Import: my interviewer shows up as "Narrator".** Set `import.interviewer_labels` in
`config.yaml` to the label(s) your interviewer uses (e.g. `[Q, Q1]`) and re-run `toolkit import`.

**Import: "No parsable paragraphs" / a file is rejected.** That transcript isn't in the expected
`[HH:MM:SS] SPEAKER: text` format (see [steps/import.md](steps/import.md)). It probably isn't a
SYNC'd transcript.

**Import: "Two transcripts yield the same interview id".** Two filenames collapse to the same id
after stripping suffixes. Rename one.

**Location tagging seems to add or drop places.** Tune the prompt (`prompts/tag_locations.md`)
and re-demo, or edit the region vocabulary in `locations/regions.yaml`. The `map` step only
knows regions listed in `locations/region_to_country.csv` — it will tell you if a tagged region
is missing from the mapping.

**`toolkit locations survey` won't run.** It needs extra software:
`pip install "transcript-toolkit[survey]"`, then `python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf`, and
a GeoNames dump (the command prints the exact download link and where to put it). The survey is
optional — you don't need it unless you're building a custom region list.

**A Batch API run (`--batch`) is taking a long time.** Batch jobs are cheaper (half price) but
run on OpenAI's own schedule — usually minutes, occasionally up to a day. It's resumable: re-run
the same command to check on it; you won't be double-charged.

**The export's tag columns aren't dropdowns in Excel.** Expected — see
[steps/export.md](steps/export.md). xlsx can't store multi-select validation.

**"Prices last verified ... — if these look wrong, check ..."** The cost figures come from a
price table shipped with the toolkit, and that message means it hasn't been checked in a while.
OpenAI publishes prices as a web page rather than an API, so nothing refreshes it automatically —
on purpose: a scraper that misread a page change could put a *wrong* number in front of you at
the moment you approve a spend, which is worse than an openly old one. The figures are still
usable (prices tend to fall, so an old table reads slightly high). To fix it, compare against the
linked page and edit `defaults/pricing.yaml` in the toolkit.

**"No pricing for model ..." from `toolkit cost`.** You are using a model newer than your
toolkit's price table. Update the toolkit (`uv tool upgrade transcript-toolkit`), or add the
model to `defaults/pricing.yaml`. Runs are not blocked by this — the spend estimate just shows
"cost unknown".

**How do I update the toolkit?** `toolkit update`, or **Update to the most recent version**
behind the gear in the app. (It runs `uv tool upgrade transcript-toolkit` for you. `toolkit
upgrade` works too.) In the app, quit and open it again afterwards — the copy already running
keeps using the old version until you do.

**The update button says uv is not installed, but I installed with uv.** Update to 0.2.7 or
later (`uv tool upgrade transcript-toolkit` in Terminal, once). An app opened from the Dock gets
almost no `PATH` from macOS, so earlier versions could not find uv from there even though it was
sitting in `~/.local/bin`. The toolkit now looks for it where it lives.

**How much have I spent?** `toolkit cost` (all steps) or `toolkit cost <step>` is the project's
cost report, and the app shows the same figures on the workspace page. Each line is priced at the
transport it actually used — `sync` or `batch` — so the total is money spent, not a hypothetical;
a closing line tells you what the synchronous part would have cost on the Batch API. It counts
every call ever made in the project, demos included, and the calls behind a prompt you have since
rewritten: re-running a step you have already run adds nothing, because its answers are kept.
`--to-n N` extrapolates a demo's per-call cost to a full run of N calls, and quotes both
transports (you haven't picked one for that run yet).

================================================================================================
# FILE: docs/examples/osf/README.md
# A real worked example (the OSF oral history archive)
================================================================================================

# Worked example — OSF Oral History

The real configuration of the archive this toolkit was built for, as a reference when setting up
your own project. Nothing here runs on its own; copy the parts you need into your workspace.

## Files

- `config.yaml` — a filled-in project config: interviewer labels, two topic sets (a broad
  8-topic **collection** and a fine 36-topic **filter**, each with its own rollup scheme), and
  location relabeling/place-tags tuned for this corpus.
- `topics/collection.xlsx`, `topics/filter.xlsx` — the two topic lists in the format
  `toolkit topics` expects (`id`, `name`, `description`). Open them to see how much detail a good
  topic `description` carries — that text is what the model reads to decide whether a clip
  belongs.
- `label_addendum.md` — project-specific labeling rules (naming conventions) referenced by
  `label.addendum`.

## Things worth copying from this example

- **Two topic sets** tagged independently: point `--set collection` / `--set filter` at each.
- **Rollup rules chosen per list**: the broad collection uses one flat 30% bar; the sparse
  36-topic filter uses rarity bins, where a rare topic gets a lower share-of-clips threshold
  than a common one. Both were picked by reading `toolkit topics thresholds --set <name>`, which draws
  what each rule would tag.
- **Location canon**: `relabel` fixes model spelling variants and merges (e.g. Israel + Palestine
  into one tag); `place_tags` keeps subnational places (Chechnya, Crimea) as their own tag.
- **Descriptions matter**: the filter topics are tagged only on a *specific, substantive* mention
  — that instruction lives in the topic descriptions and the prompt, not in code.
