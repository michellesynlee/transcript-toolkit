"""The settings in config.yaml: what each one is, and how to change one from the app.

The comments in config.yaml are the documentation of every setting, written for whoever opens
the file. `explanations()` reads them back out, so the app shows each setting with those same
words: change a comment in the file and the app's explanation changes with it. There is one
description of a setting, in one place, and it is the file itself.

That is also why `save()` edits the file as text. Loading config.yaml into Python and dumping
it back would produce a file with the same settings and not one comment left in it.
