# Configuration reference

Two levels, both YAML, in the workspace:

- **`config.yaml`** — the settings you're expected to change. One section per step.
- **`advanced/<step>.yaml`** — everything else tunable, rarely needed.

For a given step the two are merged; a key set in `config.yaml` wins. **Changing any setting
that shapes an LLM call (model, reasoning, a prompt, a topic list) makes that step's previous
demo "stale"** — the next full run will ask you to demo and review again. That's intended.

**The comments in `config.yaml` are the documentation of each setting, and the app reads them.**
It shows the comment directly above a key (plus any comment on the key's own line) as that
setting's explanation, so rewording one here changes what the app says — there is one description
of a setting and this file is where it lives. Two conventions follow from that: keep a comment
directly above its key with no blank line between, and keep the two-space indentation, which is
what lets the app change one line and leave the rest of the file — comments included — exactly as
it was. A file that has been reindented by hand still works for every command; the app just
declines to write to it and tells you to make the change here yourself.

The app shows the settings in two places: those belonging to the whole project (its name) behind
the gear, and those belonging to one step on that step's own page. `advanced/` is not shown in
the app at all — those are files to edit.

## `config.yaml`

```yaml
project:
  name: "..."                     # shown in `toolkit status`, the app and the export.
                                  # Set by `toolkit init` from the folder name (or --name);
                                  # edit it here to rename the project without moving it.

import:
  interviewer_labels: [Q]         # speaker labels used by the interviewer
  other_labels: []                # other non-narrator voices (moderators, etc.)
  strip_suffixes: [_SYNC, _final] # filename endings removed to derive the interview id

clip:      { model: gpt-5.6-sol,      reasoning: medium }
label:     { model: gpt-5.6-terra,      reasoning: medium, addendum: null }
summarize: { model: gpt-5.6-sol,      reasoning: low,    pool_sessions: true }

topics:
  model: gpt-5.6-luna
  reasoning: medium
  sets:                           # written for you when a set is first used; no default set
    collection:
      file: topics/collection.xlsx  # your topic list (xlsx/csv: name, description, [id])
      rollup: { method: freq_width, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }
      # or:  { method: equal_count, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }
      # or:  { method: flat, threshold_pct: 30 }
      # prompt: tag_topics_strict.md   # this list's own rubric, a file in prompts/
      # model: gpt-5.6-sol             # and its own model / reasoning, overriding the two above
      # reasoning: high

locations:
  model: gpt-5.6-luna
  reasoning: medium
  rollup: { method: freq_width, bins: 5, range: [10, 30] }
  relabel: {}                     # output spelling/merge fixes, e.g. {Macedonia: North Macedonia}
  place_tags: []                  # subnational places kept as their own tag, e.g. [Crimea]
```

- **model / reasoning** — the OpenAI model and reasoning effort (`none|low|medium|high|xhigh`)
  for that step. Higher reasoning = better but pricier. Model ids the pricing table knows are in
  `defaults/pricing.yaml`.
- **label.addendum** — path (relative to the workspace) to project-specific labeling rules, or
  `null`.
- **summarize.pool_sessions** — pool a narrator's session files into one summary.
- **topics.sets** — one or more topic lists; each has a `file` and a `rollup` rule (below). A
  list may also carry its own `prompt`, `model` and `reasoning`, which override the `topics`
  section for that list alone — two lists are two pieces of work, with separate demos and
  separate caches.
- **rollup** (per topic list, and once for locations) — when a topic or place becomes one of an
  interview's tags. `method` is one of:
  - `freq_width` (the default) — the topics are split into `bins` bins by how often they come
    up across the collection, over `range: [lowest, highest]` percent of an interview's clips,
    and a rarer bin gets a lower threshold. Five bins over 10–30% make the ladder 10, 15, 20,
    25, 30. Two topics that come up equally often always get the same threshold, and the
    thresholds fan out from the middle of the range only as far as the frequencies themselves
    are spread — a collection where every topic comes up about equally often is judged
    (near-)flat, instead of tiny count differences being stretched to the extremes.
  - `equal_count` — the same, except each bin holds the same number of topics. It spreads the
    thresholds evenly over your list, at the cost of splitting equally-frequent topics between
    bins.
  - `flat` — one `threshold_pct` threshold for every topic.

  `toolkit topics thresholds --set <name>` and `toolkit locations thresholds` draw what each of
  these would tag before you choose. The older spelling (`scheme: flat|binned` with the
  thresholds written out as `thresholds: [...]`) is still read, and a hand-written list is still
  used exactly as written.
- **locations.relabel / place_tags** — see [steps/locations.md](steps/locations.md).
- **export.locations** — how location tags appear in the xlsx: `countries` (only those tagged
  directly), `countries_and_regions` (default; those countries plus a separate Regions column), or
  `countries_incl_regions` (one column, with regions mapped down into it). See
  [steps/export.md](steps/export.md).
- **export.id_prefix** — put in front of every Clip Id, Interview and Session in the xlsx, e.g.
  `osf_`, so ids from different projects never collide once combined. Empty (default) for none.
  Only the spreadsheet changes; changing it takes a re-export and nothing else.

## `advanced/<step>.yaml`

Per step: `prompt` (the file in `prompts/` used), `verbosity`, `max_workers`, poll settings, and
step-specific tunables — `clip`: `chunk_threshold_tokens`, `overlap_paragraphs`; `label`:
`batch_threshold_tokens` (how many clips share one request — nothing to do with the Batch API);
`topics`/`locations`: `demo_n_clips`, `demo_seed`, and for topics `score_values`,
`justify_min_score`; `import`: `session_regex`; `locations`: `regions_file`, `region_map_file`,
`survey.*`; `export`: `filename`, `tabs`.

The steps that can use the Batch API (`clip`, `label`, `summarize`, `topics`, `locations`)
also take `batch_poll_interval_s` and `batch_max_total_wait_s` — how often to check a submitted
job, and when to stop waiting (re-running the command resumes the same job). On `clip` a batch
run goes in waves — see [steps/clip.md](steps/clip.md).

## Prompts and vocabularies

Editable files, read live at run time (changing them re-stales the demo):

- `prompts/*.md` — one prompt per LLM step. Restore a pristine copy with
  `toolkit init --reset-prompt <name>`. `toolkit status` prints which file each step reads, and
  the app has the same file behind *The prompt for this step* on that step's page.
- `topics/*.csv|xlsx` — your topic lists.
- `locations/regions.yaml`, `locations/region_to_country.csv` — the location vocabulary and
  mapping.
