# export

`toolkit export` — collect everything produced so far into one spreadsheet,
`outputs/export.xlsx`.

## Run it

```sh
toolkit export                 # -> outputs/export.xlsx
toolkit export --out final.xlsx
```

Incremental: it includes whatever steps have run. Clips only? You get a Clips tab with ids and
timings. Added labels, topics, locations, summaries? Each fills in its columns. Re-run any time;
it overwrites the file. `toolkit status` shows what the next export would include.

## What's in it

- **Clips** — one row per clip: Clip Id, Interview (narrator), Session, Start, End, Label, a
  column per topic set (the clip's tags), Locations (and Regions, depending on the mode below).
  **Start and End are empty** for a clip out of a transcript that was never SYNC'd — there are
  no times in it to report (see [import.md](import.md)). Everything else in the row is filled
  in as usual.
- **Interviews** — one row per narrator: Sessions, Summary, a column per topic set (interview
  tags), Locations (and Regions), and **Imported** — when each of the narrator's transcripts
  was read in (see [import.md](import.md)), so a sheet can be checked against a later
  correction. If any transcripts came in without timestamps
  (`data/unsynced/` — see [import.md](import.md)), a **Transcript** column says which rows are
  SYNC'd and which are not: those interviews are clipped and tagged like the rest, but their
  clips' Start and End are empty, and this column is what says that is a fact about the
  transcript rather than something that went wrong.
- **Categories** — the vocabularies (each topic set's names, the country and region lists) as
  reference columns. These follow the same mode, so you never see a reference value that appears
  in no row.

## A project prefix on every id

`config.yaml` → `export.id_prefix` (e.g. `osf_`) is put in front of every Clip Id, Interview and
Session the spreadsheet shows — `osf_fake_alpha_20240101_session1_0001` — so ids from different
projects stay distinct once their sheets are combined. It is a fact about the spreadsheet only:
the workspace's own files, review pages and `label_overrides.csv` keep the plain ids, and changing
the prefix takes a re-export and nothing else. Labels you edited in the previous sheet are still
found and kept, whatever prefix that sheet was written with.

## How locations appear

The tagger records **countries** and **regions** separately, and `toolkit locations map` expands
each region into its countries. Pick which of those views the spreadsheet shows with
`config.yaml` → `export.locations` (or `--locations MODE` for a one-off):

| mode | Locations column | Regions column |
|---|---|---|
| `countries` | only countries tagged directly | — |
| `countries_and_regions` *(default)* | only countries tagged directly | the region tags |
| `countries_incl_regions` | direct countries **plus** the regions mapped down to countries | — |

For a clip tagged `Czechia` + the region `The Balkans` (which maps to Serbia, Croatia, …):

```
countries              Locations: Czechia
countries_and_regions  Locations: Czechia          Regions: The Balkans
countries_incl_regions Locations: Czechia, Serbia, Croatia, …
```

The first two never fold regions into the countries column, so each tag appears exactly once —
use `countries_incl_regions` when you want one country column that misses nothing. Subnational
**place tags** (`locations.place_tags`, e.g. Crimea) count as directly tagged in every mode; only
region *expansions* are what the modes add or withhold.

## Labels you edited in the sheet

Re-running `toolkit export` does not undo a Label cell you changed by hand. Before overwriting
the file, export compares the sheet against what it wrote last time; a Label that differs was
edited by a person, and the edit is kept — recorded in `label_overrides.csv` (see
[label.md](label.md)) and written into the new file too. Editing a cell back to the model's own
words lifts the override again. The one thing export cannot read is a workbook that is open in
Excel or damaged — then it stops and says so rather than risk losing your edits.

## A note on Google Sheets

This is a plain `.xlsx`. Excel has no "multiple selections per cell" validation, so the tag
columns are comma-separated text and the Categories tab is just a reference list. If you upload
the file to Google Sheets and want the tag columns to be multi-select dropdowns bound to the
Categories vocabulary, you add that validation in Sheets by hand — the toolkit can't set it in
an xlsx file.
